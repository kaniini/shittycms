This is a crappy Markdown reformatter for building mindnumbingly simple websites.  It has an
object-oriented design so basically the entire thing can be overriden.

To use, you will need to clone this to an htdocs and edit config.php.sample as needed.  You
will also need to port the .htaccess file to your webserver configuration, if you don't have
.htaccess emulation.

This powers ircv3.atheme.org and some other sites.
